# Django-Weather_app
My first Django-app 
This is a basic weather_app with responsive tabs,
I used Bootstrap for front-end,you can change if you want,
It only  pull data from openweatherapi and saveit to db and show it,
If you want to reduce the loading time of the app,you can use Ajax instead of json.
I'm just using the reference to make this app,I'm not owning this.
